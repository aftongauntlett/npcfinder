- Ask clarifying questions before edits if any requirement is uncertain or risky.
- Explain key tradeoffs briefly, not essays.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without asking.
- Keep code consistent with existing patterns unless refactoring is intentional.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over cleverness.
- Choose the model appropriate to the task (Codex for complex code, Claude for reasoning, Grok for small tasks); do not escalate to a higher-tier model unless needed.

# NPC Finder

> **Track what matters. Share with friends. Keep it private.**

A modern, invite-only React app for tracking movies, TV shows, games, books, and more. Built with privacy in mind - your data is protected from other users, with plans for end-to-end encryption for truly sensitive content.

## üîê Privacy-First Design

**Invite-Only Access** - No public signups. Share codes with trusted friends only.

**Two-Tier Security Model:**

- **Standard Security**: Media tracking with friend sharing (current)
- **E2E Encryption**: Diary & health data that even the admin can't see (planned)

## üéì Learning Goals & Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates:

- **Modern React Patterns**: Hooks, Context, custom hooks, and best practices
- **Security Architecture**: Invite-only system with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Database Design**: Relational database with Supabase and PostgreSQL
- **API Integration**: Multiple external APIs with error handling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Vitest (78 tests passing)
- **Privacy by Design**: Two-tier security model (standard + E2E encryption)
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with proper interfaces
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, composable components
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure invite code system
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
- **Performance**: Optimized builds, lazy loading, efficient state management

**For Recruiters**: This is a production-ready app showcasing full-stack development, security consciousness, and thoughtful architecture.

## ü§ù Privacy Promise

**What IS Private:**

- Your data is protected from other users via Row-Level Security
- No selling, sharing, or third-party access
- No analytics or tracking
- Invite-only for trusted friends

**What Is NOT Private (Yet):**

- This isn't end-to-end encrypted like Signal (for media tracking)
- Admin can technically access the database
- Supabase (hosting provider) can access data

**Future Plans:**

- E2E encryption for diary entries (truly private thoughts)
- E2E encryption for health data (weight, fitness metrics)
- Standard security for social features (movies, recommendations)

Read the full explanation: [Privacy Reality Check](docs/PRIVACY_REALITY_CHECK.md)

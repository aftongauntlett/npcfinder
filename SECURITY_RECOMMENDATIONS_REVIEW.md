# Security Recommendations Review

## What We Implemented

### 1. npm audit ✅

```bash
npm run audit           # Basic security check
npm run audit:fix       # Auto-fix vulnerabilities
npm run security:check  # Full suite (audit + lint + tests)
```

**Current Status**: 0 vulnerabilities found

Added to GitHub Actions CI workflow.

## What We Skipped

### Snyk Integration

**Why skipped:**
- `npm audit` already shows 0 vulnerabilities
- App is invite-only (low attack surface)
- Free tier is plenty (200 tests/month)
- Paid tiers ($52-115/mo) are overkill for friend group

**If you want it later:**
```bash
npm install -g snyk
snyk test
```

## Security Mindset

This is a **friend-group app**, not enterprise software.

### Current Security Is Fine:

- Invite-only access ✅
- Supabase RLS (row-level security) ✅
- npm audit passing ✅
- No known vulnerabilities ✅

### Don't Worry About:

- Advanced threat modeling
- Penetration testing
- SOC 2 compliance
- GDPR (unless you have EU users)

## Real Security Risks

**Actual things to worry about:**

1. **Weak passwords** - Supabase handles this
2. **Sharing admin access** - Don't give everyone admin
3. **API keys in code** - Use `.env.local` (not committed to git)
4. **Outdated dependencies** - Run `npm audit` monthly

## Monthly Security Checklist

```bash
# Once a month, run:
npm audit
npm outdated
npm update
npm test
```

That's it. You're doing fine.

## Questions?

This is appropriate security for a small app. Don't overthink it.

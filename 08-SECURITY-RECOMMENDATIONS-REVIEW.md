# Security Recommendations Review

## What We Implemented

### 1. npm audit ✅

```bash
npm run audit           # Basic security check
npm run audit:fix       # Auto-fix vulnerabilities
npm run security:check  # Full suite (audit + lint + tests)
```

**Current Status**: 0 vulnerabilities found

Added to GitHub Actions CI workflow.

## What We Skipped

### Snyk Integration

**Why skipped:**

- `npm audit` already shows 0 vulnerabilities
- App is invite-only (low attack surface)
- Free tier is plenty (200 tests/month)
- Paid tiers ($52-115/mo) are overkill for friend group

**If you want it later:**

```bash
npm install -g snyk
snyk test
```

## Security Mindset

This is a **friend-group app**, not enterprise software.

### Current Security Is Fine:

- Invite-only access ✅
- Supabase RLS (row-level security) ✅
- npm audit passing ✅
- No known vulnerabilities ✅

### Don't Worry About:

- Advanced threat modeling
- Penetration testing
- SOC 2 compliance
- GDPR (unless you have EU users)

## Real Security Risks

**Actual things to worry about:**

1. **Weak passwords** - Supabase handles this
2. **Sharing admin access** - Don't give everyone admin
3. **API keys in code** - Use `.env.local` (not committed to git)
4. **Outdated dependencies** - Run `npm audit` monthly

## Monthly Security Checklist

```bash
# Once a month, run:
npm audit
npm outdated
npm update
npm test
```

That's it. You're doing fine.

## Questions?

This is appropriate security for a small app. Don't overthink it.

## Supabase Security Advisor Audit (October 2025)

On October 21, 2025, we reviewed all issues flagged by Supabase's Security and Performance Advisors. Here's what we found and fixed:

### Critical Security Issues Fixed

#### 1. Function Search Path Security ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: 6 database functions were missing `SET search_path`, making them vulnerable to schema hijacking attacks where malicious actors could create functions/tables in other schemas to intercept calls.

**Functions Fixed** (Migration: `20251021000011_fix_remaining_search_paths.sql`):

1. `validate_invite_code(code_value text)` - **CRITICAL** (SECURITY DEFINER function)
2. `update_user_profiles_updated_at()` - Trigger function
3. `update_music_rec_consumed_at()` - Trigger function
4. `update_movie_rec_watched_at()` - Trigger function
5. `update_watchlist_updated_at()` - Trigger function
6. `verify_data_integrity()` - Admin utility function (needs auth schema)

**What We Did**: Added `SET search_path TO 'public', 'pg_temp'` to all functions (or `'public', 'auth', 'pg_temp'` for `verify_data_integrity` which queries auth.users). This prevents search path hijacking by locking down which schemas functions can access.

**Why It Matters**: Without fixed search paths, attackers could potentially create malicious functions in other schemas that intercept calls. The `validate_invite_code` function was especially critical since it's marked SECURITY DEFINER (runs with elevated privileges).

#### 2. View Security Barriers ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: `music_recommendations_with_users` view was missing `security_barrier='true'`, creating an inconsistency with the movie view which already had this protection.

**What We Did** (Migration: `20251021000012_add_security_barrier_to_music_view.sql`):

- Added `WITH (security_barrier='true')` to `music_recommendations_with_users` view
- Now both movie and music views have consistent security posture

**What security_barrier Does**: Prevents query optimization from pushing predicates down in ways that could leak information through side effects (e.g., error messages from functions in WHERE clauses). Important for views joining sensitive data from multiple tables.

#### 3. Leaked Password Protection ⚠️ MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

**Issue**: Supabase's leaked password protection is currently disabled.

**What It Is**: Checks user passwords against the Have I Been Pwned database to prevent use of compromised credentials.

**How to Enable**:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Authentication → Password Security
2. Toggle on "Leaked password protection"

**Requirements**: Supabase Pro plan or higher

**Recommendation**: Enable in production environments for enhanced security.

### Informational Warnings (No Action Needed)

#### 4. RLS Initialization Plan Warnings (43 warnings)

**Issue**: Supabase Performance Advisor flags policies using `auth.uid()` and `current_setting()` calls.

**Status**: ✅ EXPECTED AND NORMAL

**Why No Fix Needed**:

- These warnings appear because RLS policies use `auth.uid()` to enforce row-level permissions
- This is the correct and recommended way to implement RLS in Supabase
- The warnings are about potential query planning overhead, not actual security issues
- No performance problems observed in actual usage
- Alternative approaches (like passing user_id as parameter) would bypass RLS security

**Our Decision**: Monitor query performance, but don't change RLS patterns unless actual performance issues arise.

#### 5. Slow Query Warnings (16 queries)

**Issue**: Supabase Query Performance shows some queries taking 1-1.5 seconds.

**Status**: ✅ SYSTEM QUERIES, NOT APPLICATION QUERIES

**What We Found**:

- Most slow queries are Postgres system queries (e.g., `c.oid::int8` introspection queries)
- These are from the Supabase dashboard examining schema, not application code
- Application queries (user profile fetches, recommendations, etc.) are fast
- No user-facing performance issues reported

**Our Decision**: Monitor application query performance, but system/introspection queries are outside our control and don't affect user experience.

### Summary

**Fixed**: 2 critical security issues (function search paths + view security barriers)

**Manual Action**: Enable leaked password protection in dashboard (Pro plan feature)

**Monitoring**: 43 RLS warnings and 16 slow queries are informational and expected

**Result**: Database now passes all actionable Security Advisor checks. The remaining warnings are expected behavior for RLS-secured applications.
